1. **What types of literals are the following two examples?**
    ```
    "Hello ", "007"
    ```
    They're both strings/string literals.

2. **What types of literals are the following four examples?**
    ```
    "1.5", 2.0, 528, False
    ```
    The first is a string, the second is a numerical literal (a float), the third is a numerical literal (an integer), and the fourth is a boolean literal.

3. **What is the decimal value of the following binary number?**
    ```
    1011
    ```
    It's `11`, because (2**0) + (2**1) + (2**3) = 11
