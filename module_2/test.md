11. **What is the output of the following snippet?**
    ```python
    x = 1
    y = 2
    z = x
    x = y
    y = z
    print(x, y)
    ```

    `2 1`

12. **What is the output of the following snippet if the user enters two lines containing 2 and 4 respectively?**
    ```python
    x = input()
    y = input()
    print(x + y)
    ```

    `24`

13. **What is the output of the following snippet if the user enters two lines containing 2 and 4 respectively?**
    ```python
    x = int(input())
    y = int(input())

    x = x // y
    y = y // x

    print(y)
    ```
    the code will cause a runtime error

14. **What is the output of the following snippet if the user enters two lines containing 2 and 4 respectively?**
    ```python
    x = int(input())

    print(y)
    ```
    `8.0`

15. **What is the output of the following snippet if the user enters two lines containing 11 and 4 respectively?**
    ```python
    x = int(input())

    x = x % y
    x = x % y
    y = y % x

    print(y)
    ```
    `1`

16. **What is the output of the following snippet if the user enters two lines containing 3 and 6 respectively?**
    ```python

    print(x)
    ```
    `17.5`

20. **What is the output of the following snippet if the user enters two lines containing 2 and 4 respectively?**
    ```python
    x = int(input())
    y = int(input())

    print(x + y)
